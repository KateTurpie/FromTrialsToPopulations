✨Background and research question

Short-acting prophylactic interventions, such as monoclonal antibodies and some vaccines, are useful prevention tools against infectious diseases. Clinical trials assess these interventions’ efficacy at preventing infection, but translating trial results into real-world, population-level effectiveness is complex. Both the protection profile of the intervention over time since administration and trial length can influence measured efficacy. Furthermore, the way modellers interpret trial-measured efficacy affects their assessment of the potential population-level impact and cost-effectiveness of the intervention.

This project aims to address two key questions:

How do combinations of initial efficacy, duration of protection, and length of observation, affect efficacy measured in clinical trial? How does incorporating the uncertainty in the protection profile underlying measured efficacy affect our assessment of the potential impact of the intervention's population-level effectiveness?

✨Methods

1.  Mathematical Simulation of Clinical Trials:

     •   Develop a simulation model replicating a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of a pharmaceutical prophylaxis                    against an infectious disease.

     •   Analyse how measured efficacy varies with initial efficacy, protection waning rates, and trial duration.

 2.        Dynamic Transmission Modeling:

     •   Construct a dynamic transmission model to simulate disease spread at the population level.

     •   Examine the relationship between trial-measured efficacy and population-level impact, identifying scenarios                   where incorrect parameterization of efficacy and duration leads to underestimation or overestimation of                       effectiveness.
✨Outcome

The student will develop expertise in:

     •   Mathematical modeling of infectious diseases: Understanding disease dynamics and intervention impacts.

     •   Coding in R: Implementing models and analyzing data.

     •   Numerical solutions of ordinary differential equations (ODEs): Using the ‘odin’ package in R.
Outcomes will provide insights into best practices for infectious disease modeling and enhance understanding of how model specifications affect predictions of intervention impact.
